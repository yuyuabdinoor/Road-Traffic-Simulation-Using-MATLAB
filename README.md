# Road-Traffic-Simulation-Using-MATLAB
Developed a MATLAB simulation project for traffic in Nairobi City to address congestion issues, using 3D models and scenarios to analyze traffic flow and propose solutions. The project involves system design, implementation, and testing to create an interactive urban traffic simulation.

Developed a prototype for simulating traffic scenarios in Nairobi using MATLAB and Simulink, integrating elements like roads, vehicles, and signals. Future improvements include real data integration, advanced modeling features, database integration, and user-friendly interfaces for city planners. Constraints were encountered in attempting to remotely control the ego vehicle.
